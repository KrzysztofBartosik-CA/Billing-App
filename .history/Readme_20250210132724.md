## Installation

To install the dependencies for both the server and the client, run the following commands:

```sh
# Navigate to the root directory of the project
cd /path/to/Billing-project

# Install server dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to the client directory
cd client/billing-app

# Install client dependencies
yarn install
```

## Running MongoDB

To run MongoDB, use the following command:

```sh
mongod
```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:2000`.

## Running the Client

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```

or

```sh
yarn start
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
